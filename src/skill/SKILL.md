# /story — Project Context & Session Management

claudestory tracks tickets, issues, roadmap, and handovers in a `.story/` directory so every AI coding session builds on the last instead of starting from zero.

## How to Handle Arguments

`/story` is one smart command. Parse the user's intent from context:

- `/story` → full context load (default, see Step 2 below)
- `/story handover` → draft a session handover. Summarize the session's work, then call `claudestory_handover_create` with the drafted content and a descriptive slug
- `/story snapshot` → save project state (call `claudestory_snapshot` MCP tool)
- `/story export` → export project for sharing. Ask the user whether to export the current phase or the full project, then call `claudestory_export` with either `phase` or `all` set
- `/story status` → quick status check (call `claudestory_status` MCP tool)
- `/story help` → show all capabilities (read `~/.claude/skills/story/reference.md`)

If the user's intent doesn't match any of these, use the full context load.

## Step 0: Check Setup

Check if the claudestory MCP tools are available by looking for `claudestory_status` in your available tools.

**If MCP tools ARE available** → proceed to Step 1.

**If MCP tools are NOT available:**

1. Check if the `claudestory` CLI is installed: run `claudestory --version` via Bash
2. If NOT installed:
   - Check `node --version` and `npm --version` — both must be available
   - If Node.js is missing, tell the user to install Node.js 20+ first
   - Otherwise, with user permission, run: `npm install -g @anthropologies/claudestory`
   - Then run: `claude mcp add claudestory -s user -- claudestory --mcp`
   - Tell the user to restart Claude Code and run `/story` again
3. If CLI IS installed but MCP not registered:
   - With user permission, run: `claude mcp add claudestory -s user -- claudestory --mcp`
   - Tell the user to restart Claude Code and run `/story` again

**Important:** Always use `npm install -g`, never `npx`, for the CLI. The MCP server needs the global binary.

**If MCP tools are unavailable and user doesn't want to set up**, fall back to CLI mode:
- Run `claudestory status` via Bash
- Run `claudestory recap` via Bash
- Run `claudestory handover latest` via Bash
- Read `RULES.md` and `WORK_STRATEGIES.md` if they exist in the project root
- Run `git log --oneline -10`
- Then continue to Step 3 below

## Step 1: Check Project

- If `.story/` exists in the current working directory (or a parent) → proceed to Step 2
- If no `.story/` but project indicators exist (code, manifest, .git) → run the **AI-Assisted Setup Flow** below
- If no `.story/` and no project indicators → explain what claudestory is and suggest navigating to a project

### AI-Assisted Setup Flow

This flow creates a meaningful `.story/` project instead of empty scaffolding. Claude analyzes the project, proposes structure, and creates everything via MCP tools.

#### 1a. Detect Project Type

Check for project indicators to determine if this is an **existing project** or a **new/empty project**:

- `package.json` → npm/node (read `name`, `description`, check for `typescript` dep)
- `Cargo.toml` → Rust
- `go.mod` → Go
- `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` → Python
- `*.xcodeproj` / `Package.swift` → Swift/macOS
- `*.sln` / `*.csproj` → C#/.NET
- `Gemfile` → Ruby
- `build.gradle.kts` / `build.gradle` → Android/Kotlin/Java (or Spring Boot)
- `pubspec.yaml` → Flutter/Dart
- `angular.json` → Angular
- `svelte.config.js` → SvelteKit
- `.git/` → has version history

If none found (empty or near-empty directory) → skip to **1c. New Project Interview**.

#### 1b. Existing Project — Analyze

Read these files to understand the project (skip any that don't exist, skip files > 50KB):

1. **README.md** — project description, goals, feature list, roadmap/TODO sections
2. **Package manifest** — project name, dependencies, scripts
3. **CLAUDE.md** — existing project spec (if any)
4. **Top-level directory listing** — identify major components (src/, test/, docs/, etc.)
5. **Git summary** — `git log --oneline -20` for recent work patterns
6. **GitHub issues (ask user first)** — `gh issue list --limit 30 --state open --json number,title,labels,body,createdAt`. If gh fails (auth, rate limit, no remote), skip cleanly and note "GitHub import skipped: [reason]"

**Framework-specific deep scan** — after detecting the project type in 1a, scan deeper into framework conventions to understand architecture:

- **Next.js / Nuxt:** Check `app/` vs `pages/` routing, scan `app/api/` or `pages/api/` for API routes, read `next.config.*` / `nuxt.config.*`, check for middleware.
- **Express / Fastify / Koa:** Scan for route files (`routes/`, `src/routes/`), look for `router.get/post` patterns, identify service/controller layers.
- **NestJS:** Read `nest-cli.json`, scan `src/` for `*.module.ts`, check for controllers and services.
- **React (CRA / Vite) / Vue / Svelte:** Check `src/components/` structure, look for state management imports (redux, zustand, pinia), identify routing setup.
- **Angular:** Read `angular.json`, scan `src/app/` for modules and components, check for services and guards.
- **Django / FastAPI / Flask:** Check for `manage.py`, scan for app directories or router files, look at models and migrations.
- **Spring Boot:** Check `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` for Spring deps, scan `src/main/java` for controller/service/repository layers.
- **Rust:** Check `Cargo.toml` for workspace members, scan for `mod.rs` / `lib.rs` structure, identify crate types.
- **Swift / Xcode:** Check `.xcodeproj` or `Package.swift`, identify SwiftUI vs UIKit, scan for targets.
- **Android (Kotlin/Java):** Check `build.gradle.kts`, scan `app/src/main/` for activity/fragment/composable structure, check `AndroidManifest.xml`, identify Compose vs XML layouts.
- **Flutter / Dart:** Check `pubspec.yaml`, scan `lib/` for feature folders (models/, screens/, widgets/, services/), check for state management imports (provider, riverpod, bloc).
- **Go:** Check `go.mod`, scan for `cmd/` and `internal/`/`pkg/`, check for `Makefile`.
- **Monorepo:** If `packages/`, `apps/`, or workspace config detected, list each package with its purpose before proposing phases.
- **Other:** Scan `src/` two levels deep and identify dominant patterns (MVC, service layers, feature folders).

**Derive project metadata:**
- **name**: from package manifest `name` field, or directory name
- **type**: from package manager (npm, cargo, pip, etc.)
- **language**: from file extensions and manifest

**Assess project stage** from the data — don't use fixed thresholds. A project with 3 commits and a half-written README is greenfield. A project with 500+ commits, test suites, and release tags is mature. A project with 200 commits and active PRs is active development. Use your judgment.

**Propose 3-7 phases** reflecting the project's actual development trajectory. Examples:
- Library: setup → core-api → documentation → testing → publishing
- App: mvp → auth → data-layer → ui-polish → deployment
- Mid-development project: capture completed work as early phases, then plan forward

**Propose initial tickets** per active phase (2-5 each), based on:
- README TODOs or roadmap sections (treat as hints, not ground truth)
- GitHub issues if imported — infer from label semantics: bug/defect labels → issues, enhancement/feature labels → tickets
- Obvious gaps (missing tests, no CI, no docs, etc.)
- If more than 30 GitHub issues exist, note "Showing 30 of N. Additional issues can be imported later."

**Important:** Only mark phases complete if explicitly confirmed by user or docs — do NOT infer completion from git history alone.

#### 1c. New Project — Interview

Ask the user:
1. "What are you building?" — project name and purpose
2. "What's the tech stack?" — language, framework, project type
3. "What are the major milestones?" — helps define phases
4. "What's the first thing to build?" — seeds the first ticket

Propose phases and initial tickets from the answers.

#### 1d. Present Proposal

Show the user a structured proposal (table format, not raw JSON):
- **Project:** name, type, language
- **Phases** (table: id, name, description)
- **Tickets per phase** (title, type, status)
- **Issues** (if GitHub import was used)

Ask: "Does this look right? I can adjust phases, add/remove tickets, or change anything before creating."

Iterate section by section until the user approves.

#### 1e. Execute on Approval

1. Call `claudestory_init` with name, type, language — after this, all MCP tools become available dynamically
2. Call `claudestory_phase_create` for each phase — first phase with `atStart: true`, subsequent with `after: <previous-phase-id>`
3. Call `claudestory_ticket_create` for each ticket
4. Call `claudestory_issue_create` for each imported GitHub issue
5. Call `claudestory_ticket_update` to mark already-complete tickets as `complete`
6. Call `claudestory_snapshot` to save initial baseline

#### 1f. Post-Setup

After creation completes:
- Confirm what was created (e.g., "Created 5 phases, 12 tickets, and 3 issues")
- Check if `.gitignore` includes `.story/snapshots/` (warn if missing — snapshots should not be committed)
- Suggest creating `CLAUDE.md` if it doesn't exist (project spec for AI sessions)
- Suggest creating `RULES.md` if it doesn't exist (development constraints)
- Write an initial handover documenting the setup decisions
- Proceed to Step 2 (Load Context) to show the new project state

## Step 2: Load Context (Default /story Behavior)

Call these in order:

1. **Project status** — call `claudestory_status` MCP tool
2. **Session recap** — call `claudestory_recap` MCP tool (shows changes since last snapshot)
3. **Recent handovers** — call `claudestory_handover_latest` MCP tool with `count: 3` (last 3 sessions' context — ensures reasoning behind recent decisions is preserved, not just the latest session's state)
4. **Development rules** — read `RULES.md` if it exists in the project root
5. **Lessons learned** — read `WORK_STRATEGIES.md` if it exists in the project root
6. **Recent commits** — run `git log --oneline -10`

## Step 3: Present Summary

After loading context, present a concise summary:

- Project progress (X/Y tickets complete, current phase)
- What changed since last snapshot (from recap)
- What the last session accomplished (from handover)
- Next ticket to work on
- Any high-severity issues or blockers
- Key process rules (from WORK_STRATEGIES.md if it exists)

For collaborative sessions, `claudestory_recommend` provides context-aware suggestions mixing tickets and issues. For autonomous sessions, `claudestory_ticket_next` provides queue-based next ticket.

Then ask: **"What would you like to work on?"**

## Session Lifecycle

- **Snapshots** save project state for diffing. They may be auto-taken before context compaction.
- **Handovers** are session continuity documents. Create one at the end of significant sessions.
- **Recaps** show what changed since the last snapshot — useful for understanding drift.

**Never modify or overwrite existing handover files.** Handovers are append-only historical records. Always create new handover files — never edit, replace, or write to an existing one. If you need to correct something from a previous session, create a new handover that references the correction. This prevents accidental data loss during sessions.

Before writing a handover at the end of a session, run `claudestory snapshot` first. This ensures the next session's recap can show what changed. If `setup-skill` has been run, a PreCompact hook auto-takes snapshots before context compaction.

## Ticket and Issue Discipline

**Tickets** are planned work — features, tasks, refactors. They represent intentional, scoped commitments.

**Ticket types:**
- `task` — Implementation work: building features, writing code, fixing bugs, refactoring.
- `feature` — A user-facing capability or significant new functionality. Larger scope than a task.
- `chore` — Maintenance, publishing, documentation, cleanup. No functional change to the product.

**Issues** are discovered problems — bugs, inconsistencies, gaps, risks found during work. If you're not sure whether something is a ticket or an issue, make it an issue. It can be promoted to a ticket later.

When working on a task and you encounter a bug, inconsistency, or improvement opportunity that is out of scope for the current ticket, create an issue using `claudestory issue create` (CLI) with a clear title, severity, and impact description. Don't fix it in the current task, don't ignore it — log it. This keeps the issue tracker growing organically and ensures nothing discovered during work is lost.

When starting work on a ticket, update its status to `inprogress`. When done, update to `complete` in the same commit as the code change.

## Managing Tickets and Issues

Ticket and issue create/update operations are available via both CLI and MCP tools. Delete remains CLI-only.

CLI examples:
- `claudestory ticket create --title "..." --type task --phase p0`
- `claudestory ticket update T-001 --status complete`
- `claudestory issue create --title "..." --severity high --impact "..."`

MCP examples:
- `claudestory_ticket_create` with `title`, `type`, and optional `phase`, `description`, `blockedBy`, `parentTicket`
- `claudestory_ticket_update` with `id` and optional `status`, `title`, `order`, `description`, `phase`, `parentTicket`
- `claudestory_issue_create` with `title`, `severity`, `impact`, and optional `components`, `relatedTickets`, `location`, `phase`
- `claudestory_issue_update` with `id` and optional `status`, `title`, `severity`, `impact`, `resolution`, `components`, `relatedTickets`, `location`

Read operations (list, get, next, blocked) are available via both CLI and MCP.

## Notes

**Notes** are unstructured brainstorming artifacts — ideas, design thinking, "what if" explorations. Use notes when the content doesn't fit tickets (planned work) or issues (discovered problems).

Create notes via CLI: `claudestory note create --content "..." --tags idea`

Create notes via MCP: `claudestory_note_create` with `content`, optional `title` and `tags`.

List, get, and update notes via MCP: `claudestory_note_list`, `claudestory_note_get`, `claudestory_note_update`. Delete remains CLI-only: `claudestory note delete <id>`.
