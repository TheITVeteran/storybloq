# Autonomous & Tiered Modes

This file is referenced from SKILL.md for `/story auto`, `/story review`, `/story plan`, and `/story guided` commands.

## Autonomous Mode

`/story auto` starts an autonomous coding session. The guide picks tickets, plans, reviews, implements, and commits -- looping until all tickets are done or the session limit is reached.

**How it works:**

1. Call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start" }`
2. The guide returns an instruction with ticket candidates and exact JSON for the next call
3. Follow every instruction exactly. Call the guide back after each step.
4. The guide advances through: PICK_TICKET -> PLAN -> PLAN_REVIEW -> IMPLEMENT -> CODE_REVIEW -> FINALIZE -> COMPLETE -> loop
5. Continue until the guide returns SESSION_END

**Frontend design:** If the current ticket involves UI, frontend, components, layouts, or styling, read `design/design.md` in the same directory as the skill file for design principles. Load the relevant platform reference from `design/references/`. Apply the priority order (clarity > hierarchy > platform correctness > accessibility > state completeness) during both planning and implementation.

**Critical rules for autonomous mode:**
- Do NOT use Claude Code's plan mode -- write plans as markdown files
- Do NOT ask the user for confirmation or approval
- Do NOT stop or summarize between tickets -- call the guide IMMEDIATELY
- Follow the guide's instructions exactly -- it specifies which tools to call, what parameters to use
- After each step completes, call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `action: "report"` and the results

**Recommended setup for long sessions:**

Run Claude Code with: `claude --model claude-opus-4-6 --dangerously-skip-permissions`

- **Skip-permissions** enables unattended execution -- no approval prompts consuming context
- **Claude Story handles compaction automatically** -- context preserved across compactions, do not cancel because context feels large
- Use only in **trusted repositories** -- skip-permissions disables safety prompts for all tool use

**If the guide says to compact:** Call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `action: "pre_compact"`, then run `/compact`, then call with `action: "resume"`.

**If something goes wrong:**
- Context feels large -- do nothing, compaction is automatic via hooks
- Compaction happened -- call with `action: "resume"` to continue
- Session stuck after compact -- run `claudestory session clear-compact` in terminal, then `action: "resume"`
- Unrecoverable error -- run `claudestory session stop` in terminal (admin escape hatch)

## Targeted Mode

`/story auto T-183 T-184 ISS-077 T-185` starts an autonomous session that works ONLY on the specified items, in order, then ends.

**How it works:**

1. Call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "targetWork": ["T-183", "T-184", "ISS-077", "T-185"] }`
2. The guide validates all IDs, filters out already-complete items, and presents only target items as candidates
3. Session works through each item via the standard pipeline (T-XXX through PLAN, ISS-XXX through ISSUE_FIX)
4. Session ends when all targets are done (or all remaining are blocked)

**Behavior details:**
- Session cap is auto-set to the number of targets
- PICK_TICKET only shows target items -- the agent cannot pick non-target work
- Array order is respected -- first unworked item is suggested
- Blocked targets are warned about at start but included (completing earlier targets may unblock them)
- Already-complete targets are filtered out at start with a warning
- Invalid IDs cause a hard error before session creation
- Compact/resume preserves targetWork -- the session continues where it left off
- If all remaining targets are blocked by items outside the list, session ends with an explanation

**Use when:**
- Triaging a specific set of high-priority items
- Breaking up work into focused sprints
- Working through a dependency chain in order
- Fixing a cascade of related issues

## Tiered Access -- Review, Plan, Guided Modes

The autonomous guide supports four execution tiers. Same guide, same handlers, different entry/exit points.

### `/story review T-XXX`

"I wrote code for T-XXX, review it." Enters at CODE_REVIEW, loops review rounds, exits on approval.

1. Call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "mode": "review", "ticketId": "T-XXX" }`
2. The guide enters CODE_REVIEW -- follow its diff capture and review instructions
3. On approve: session ends automatically. On revise/reject: fix code, re-review
4. After approval, you can proceed to commit -- the guide does NOT auto-commit in review mode

**Note:** Review mode relaxes git constraints -- dirty working tree is allowed since the user has code ready for review.

### `/story plan T-XXX`

"Help me plan T-XXX." Enters at PLAN, runs PLAN_REVIEW rounds, exits on approval.

1. Call `claudestory_autonomous_guide` with `{ "sessionId": null, "action": "start", "mode": "plan", "ticketId": "T-XXX" }`
2. The guide enters PLAN -- write the implementation plan as a markdown file
3. On plan review approve: session ends automatically. On revise/reject: revise plan, re-review
4. The approved plan is saved in `.story/sessions/<id>/plan.md`

### `/story guided T-XXX` (deprecated -- alias for targeted auto)

Use `/story auto T-XXX` instead. A single-ticket targeted auto session is equivalent. The guide handler still accepts `mode: "guided"` for backward compatibility but routes to the same targeted auto path.

### All tiered modes:
- Require a `ticketId` -- no ad-hoc review without a ticket in V1
- Use the same review process as auto mode (same backends, same adaptive depth)
- Can be cancelled with `action: "cancel"` at any point
