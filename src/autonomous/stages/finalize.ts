/**
 * FINALIZE stage — 3-checkpoint sub-machine for staging, pre-commit, and commit.
 *
 * Checkpoints (tracked via state.finalizeCheckpoint):
 * 1. files_staged → verify staged files, overlap detection (ISS-025)
 * 2. precommit_passed → verify staging intact after hooks
 * 3. commit_done → validate commit hash, advance to COMPLETE
 *
 * enter(): Instruction to stage files.
 * report(): Process checkpoint actions via retry (sub-steps) and advance (commit done).
 *
 * HIGHEST RISK extraction — copied verbatim from handleReportFinalize.
